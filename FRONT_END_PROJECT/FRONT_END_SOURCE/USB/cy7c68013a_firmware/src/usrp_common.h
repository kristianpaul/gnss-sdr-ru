/*
 * From TRM page 15-105:
 *
 * Under certain conditions, some read and write access to the FX2
 * registers must be separated by a "synchronization delay".  The
 * delay is necessary only under the following conditions:
 *
 *   - between a write to any register in the 0xE600 - 0xE6FF range 
 *     and a write to one of the registers listed below.
 *
 *   - between a write to one of the registers listed below and a read 
 *     from any register in the 0xE600 - 0xE6FF range.
 *
 *   Registers which require a synchronization delay:
 *
 *	FIFORESET			FIFOPINPOLAR
 *	INPKTEND			EPxBCH:L
 *	EPxFIFOPFH:L			EPxAUTOINLENH:L
 *	EPxFIFOCFG			EPxGPIFFLGSEL
 *	PINFLAGSAB			PINFLAGSCD
 *	EPxFIFOIE			EPxFIFOIRQ
 *	GPIFIE				GPIFIRQ
 *	UDMACRCH:L			GPIFADRH:L
 *	GPIFTRIG			EPxGPIFTRIG
 *	OUTPKTEND			REVCTL
 *	GPIFTCB3			GPIFTCB2
 *	GPIFTCB1			GPIFTCB0
